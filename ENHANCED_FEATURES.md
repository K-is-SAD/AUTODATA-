# Enhanced AUTODATA Features

## 🚀 New Features Overview

This enhanced version of AUTODATA includes powerful new capabilities for comprehensive data analysis and visualization.

## 📊 Multiple SQL Queries Generation

### What's New
- **Intelligent Query Decomposition**: The system now analyzes complex user questions and automatically generates multiple SQL queries when needed
- **Step-by-Step Analysis**: Complex questions are broken down into logical steps with separate queries
- **Comprehensive Results**: Multiple queries are executed and results are combined for complete analysis

### How It Works
1. **Question Analysis**: The LLM analyzes the user's question to determine if multiple queries are needed
2. **Query Generation**: Generates up to 5 SQL queries with descriptions and step numbers
3. **Execution**: All queries are executed sequentially
4. **Result Combination**: Results are combined for comprehensive analysis
5. **Visualization**: Enhanced plots are generated from the combined results

### Example Use Cases
- **"Compare sales by region and show top performers"**
  - Query 1: Sales by region aggregation
  - Query 2: Top performers identification
  - Query 3: Detailed data for top regions

- **"Analyze customer behavior and demographics"**
  - Query 1: Customer behavior metrics
  - Query 2: Demographics breakdown
  - Query 3: Cross-analysis of behavior vs demographics

## 🎯 How to Use Enhanced Features

### 1. Multiple SQL Queries
```python
# Simply ask complex questions - the system will automatically generate multiple queries
user_question = "Analyze sales performance by region and identify top performing products"
# The system will generate:
# - Query 1: Sales by region
# - Query 2: Product performance ranking
# - Query 3: Top products by region
```

### 2. Comprehensive Analysis
```python
# Click the "📊 Comprehensive Analysis" button
# This will automatically generate:
# - Univariate statistics for all variables
# - Bivariate relationships

# - Correlation analysis
# - Enhanced visualizations
```

### 3. Enhanced Visualizations
```python
# Visualizations are automatically generated based on:
# - Data types (numerical vs categorical)
# - Relationships detected
# - User query context
# - Statistical significance
```
